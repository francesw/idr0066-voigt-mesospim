Protocol Description The brain from a 6 week old VIPCre-tdTomato ((Viptm1(cre)Zjh/J); B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J) mouse was extracted after transcardial perfusion with PBS followed by an ice-cold hydrogel solution  (1% PFA, 4% acrylamide, 0.05% bis-acrylamide). The brains were dissected and post-fixed  in the same hydrogel solution for 24h at 4°C. The samples were then degassed using a dessicator  before hydrogel polymerization was induced at 37°C for 2-3hours. Following the polymerization, excess hydrogel was removed from the brains and they were immersed in 40mL of 8% SDS and kept shaking at room temperature until the tissue was cleared sufficiently (30+ days for an adult animal). Finally, after 2-4 washes in PBS, the brains were put into a self-made refractive index matching solution (RIMS, Yang et al 2014) for the last clearing step. They were left to euqilibrate in 5mL of  RIMS  for at least 4 days before being imaged. After clearing, brains were attached to a small weight and loaded into a 10×20×45 mm3 quartz cuvette (UQ-205, Portmann Instruments), then submerged in RIMS and imaged using the mesoSPIM. The sample cuvette was immersed in a 40×40×40 mm3 quartz cuvette (UQ-753, Portmann Instruments) filled with index-matching oil (19569, Code 50350, Cargille, nD=1.45), which allows sample XYZ movements and rotations without refocusing the detection path. This set of animal experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with standard ethical guidelines and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich. The excitation was set to 561 nm, emission filter: 561LP Edge Basic, AHF.

Protocol Description	Briefly, the central nervous system from mice expressing EGFP in glycinergic neurons was dissected and cleared using the XCLARITY protocol. Mice (GlyT2::eGFP (Tg(Scl6a5-EGFP)1Uze)69, were perfused transcardially with 10 ml of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM 
NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 20 mM glucose equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2) at room temperature (RT) followed by 
20 ml of RT 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The perfusion was performed using a 
gravity perfusion setup. Brain 1493 and spinal cord attached were dissected and put in 4% PFA overnight. They were then put in 4% acrylamide (161–0140; Bio-Rad) and 0.25% VA-044 (017–19362; Novachem) in PBS at 4°C. They were then incubated for 3 hours at 37°C for acrylamide polymerization, washed overnight at 37°C in clearing solution 
(200 mM SDS (L3371; Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 mM 1497 boric acid (L185094; Sigma-Aldrich), pH 8.5), and electrophoresed 
in clearing solution using an X-CLARITY Tissue Clearing System (Logos Biosystems) for 8 hours at 1.2 A constant current, temperature <37°C, and 100 rpm pump speed. The samples were incubated in approximately 88% Histodenz (D2158; Sigma-Aldrich) solution in PBS (refractive index 1501 adjusted to 1.457) overnight, and mounted for imaging in the same solution. To accommodate the whole CNS, the sample was placed in a custom quartz imaging cuvette (10×20×120 mm3,
Portmann Instruments AG) and then placed in a custom 40×40×120 mm3 quartz immersion cuvette (Portmann Instruments AG). To ease mounting inside the sample cuvette, the sample was attached to a 1×13 cm strip of black aluminum foil (Thorlabs BKF12) using quick glue. This set of animal experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with standard ethical guidelines and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich.

Protocol Description The embryo was sacrificed at day 7 of development and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 2 hours at room temperature. For best results, the embryo was kept in constant, gentle motion throughout 
the staining procedure. Incubation was at 4°C. The tissue was permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 hours, 
followed by an overnight incubation in 20 mM lysine in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Then the embryo was rinsed 
with five changes of PBS. Non-specific binding was blocked using 10% FCS (fetal calf serum) in PBS for 48 hours. 
The primary antibody mouse anti-neurofilament (1:1500, RMO270, Invitrogen 13-0700) was added for 60 hours. The 
primary antibody was removed and the tissue rinsed with ten changes of PBS and an additional incubation overnight. 
After re-blocking in FCS/PBS for 15 hours, the embryo was incubated with the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-165-003) for 48 hours. In a next step, the embryo was washed ten times with PBS followed by incubation overnight in PBS. For imaging the tissue was dehydrated in a methanol gradient (25%, 50%, 
75% in H2O and 2x 100%, 2 hours each step) and cleared using 1:2 benzyl alcohol: benzyl benzoate (BABB) solution 
overnight (again gentle shaking is recommended for dehydration and clearing). The tissue and staining are stable for months when kept at 4°C in the dark. This set of animal experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with standard ethical guidelines and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich.
